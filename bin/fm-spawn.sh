# Spawn a direct report: a crewmate in a treehouse or Orca worktree, or a
# secondmate in its isolated firstmate home.
# Usage: fm-spawn.sh <task-id> <project-dir> [--harness <name>|harness|launch-command] [--model <name>] [--effort <level>] [--backend <name>] [--scout]
#        fm-spawn.sh <task-id> [<firstmate-home>] [--harness <name>|harness|launch-command] [--model <name>] [--effort <level>] [--backend <name>] --secondmate
#        fm-spawn.sh --supported-harnesses
#   --harness <name> is the explicit per-spawn harness/profile adapter. The old
#   positional harness arg still works for back-compat.
#   --model <name> and --effort <low|medium|high|xhigh|max> are concrete profile
#   axes chosen by firstmate at intake. They are only threaded into harnesses whose
#   installed CLIs were verified to support that axis; unsupported axes are omitted
#   from that harness's launch rather than guessed.
#   Codex launches also require the tracked .codex/config.toml profile and pass its
#   sandbox_mode, approval_policy, and approvals_reviewer values as CLI overrides.
#   A Codex direct report gets one per-task state/.crew-signal/<id>/ writable root,
#   with public state/<id>.status and state/<id>.turn-ended paths symlinked into it.
#   A Codex CREWMATE additionally gets sandbox_workspace_write.network_access, which
#   is what lets it reach the local no-mistakes daemon socket; a Codex secondmate does
#   not. Those grants live on the launch line rather than in the profile file on
#   purpose (docs/codex-sandbox-network.md, docs/codex-status-signalling.md).
#   --backend <name> is the explicit runtime session-provider backend for this
#   spawn. Without it, the script resolves FM_BACKEND, then config/backend, then
#   runtime auto-detection (the runtime firstmate itself is executing inside -
#   $TMUX, HERDR_ENV=1, or cmux runtime signals; bin/fm-backend.sh's
#   fm_backend_detect, with cmux fallback details in docs/cmux-backend.md),
#   then tmux.
#   Spawn-capable backends are the reference tmux adapter and experimental
#   herdr, zellij, orca, and cmux. Orca owns both the task worktree and
#   terminal, so ship/scout Orca spawns do not run treehouse get; cmux is a
#   session provider only, exactly like herdr/zellij, so it does. An
#   auto-detected herdr or cmux spawn prints a loud stderr notice;
#   auto-detected tmux stays silent; zellij and orca are never auto-detected.
#   codex-app is not a known backend yet; docs/codex-app-backend.md owns that
#   blocked backend contract. Default tmux spawns do not write backend= to meta;
#   absent backend= means tmux. cmux does not support --secondmate spawns yet.
#   A backend spawn refusal (missing dependency, version gate, unauthenticated
#   socket, or unsupported secondmate mode) is terminal for that selected backend;
#   callers must surface it instead of silently retrying another backend.
#   Herdr additionally supports a default-off presentation-only layout when the
#   local config/herdr-presentation-spaces flag exists. A clean fresh task first
#   writes state/<id>.herdr-presentation atomically, then creates a disposable
#   workspace containing only the ordinary task pane. The journal and visible
#   random token are never endpoint or ownership authority. Existing, ambiguous,
#   or recovered state is never adopted, reused, closed, or deleted through that
#   presentation path; a flat launch is allowed only after duplicate-agent risk
#   is independently absent. Treehouse allocation and task metadata are unchanged.
#   A clean projected create makes one bounded attempt to hold the one
#   session-scoped presentation-order lock (keyed by named session plus
#   canonical socket, outside any home's state/) through launch handoff. Lock
#   contention warns and falls back to the ordinary flat layout before any
#   projection mutation. The exact response-derived new workspace is inserted
#   immediately after its owning parent (firstmate or 2ndmate-<id>) contiguous
#   child block. Ordering never authorizes lifecycle cleanup, and any
#   unavailable, ambiguous, or failed move warns while the spawn continues.
#   Every projected create, prune, and move captures and verifies the named
#   session's exact active workspace and tab. A detected focus change restores
#   only that exact tab id; an ambiguous pre-operation snapshot refuses the
#   focus-sensitive presentation mutation.
#   Every single-task invocation holds one task-id-scoped lock across backend
#   creation through metadata publication, so concurrent same-id spawns serialize
#   even when they select different backends.
#   With no harness arg, a crewmate/scout spawn resolves the CREW harness only when
#   config/crew-dispatch.json is absent. When that file exists, crewmate/scout
#   spawns require an explicit harness so firstmate cannot silently skip dispatch
#   profile consultation. A --secondmate spawn is exempt and resolves the SECONDMATE
#   harness (config/secondmate-harness -> config/crew-harness -> own), so the
#   secondmate-vs-crewmate split is DURABLE across every respawn (recovery,
#   /updatefirstmate, restart). A bare adapter name (claude|codex|opencode|pi|grok)
#   overrides it for this spawn (either kind). A non-flag string containing
#   whitespace is treated as a RAW launch command - the escape hatch for verifying
#   new adapters.
#   config/secondmate-harness may also carry an optional model and effort as extra
#   whitespace-separated tokens ("<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]"). For a
#   --secondmate spawn, those tokens apply only when this spawn also resolves its
#   harness from config/secondmate-harness. An explicit per-spawn --harness,
#   positional harness arg, or raw launch command starts with clean model/effort
#   defaults unless the caller also passes explicit --model/--effort flags. When
#   the file governs the spawn, its model/effort tokens are re-resolved on every
#   respawn exactly like the harness axis, and explicit --model/--effort flags
#   still win over the file's tokens.
#   A --secondmate spawn also propagates the primary's declared inherited local
#   material, so the secondmate's OWN crewmates inherit primary config and the
#   secondmate receives the primary's read-only shared captain-preference file
#   (fm-config-inherit-lib.sh). A successful launch clears pending inherited
#   config reread generations because the new agent reads the converged files.
#   --scout records kind=scout in the task's meta (report deliverable, scratch worktree;
#   see AGENTS.md task lifecycle); --secondmate records kind=secondmate and launches in a
#   provisioned firstmate home; the default is kind=ship.
#   A home whose config/role is `coordinator` owns no crews, so ship and scout
#   spawns are refused here (docs/configuration.md "Vessel role"). --secondmate is
#   unaffected: a persistent secondmate is a separate mechanism, not a crew. The
#   refusal is a misconfiguration backstop, not a security boundary - anything
#   running as this account can edit config/role or drive a backend directly.
#   Before a secondmate launch, the home is locally fast-forwarded to the primary
#   default-branch commit when safe; skipped syncs warn and launch unchanged.
#   Ship/scout spawns refuse to launch unless the resolved task path is a real
#   git worktree root distinct from the primary project checkout.
# Batch dispatch: pass one or more `id=repo` pairs instead of a single <id> <project>, e.g.
#     fm-spawn.sh fix-a-k3=projects/foo add-b-q7=projects/bar [--scout]
#   Each pair re-execs this script in single-task mode, so the single path stays the only
#   source of truth; shared --scout/--harness/--model/--effort/--backend applies to every pair.
#   If config/crew-dispatch.json exists, shared --harness is required for crewmate
#   and scout batches. The loop lives here, in bash, so callers never hand-write a
#   multi-task shell loop (the tool shell is zsh, which does not word-split unquoted
#   $vars and silently breaks ad-hoc `for ... in $pairs` loops).
#   Launch templates live in launch_template() below; placeholders replaced before launch:
#     __BRIEF__    absolute path to data/<task-id>/brief.md. Every template passes
#                  this PATH to `fm-operational-input.sh launch-pointer`, never the
#                  brief's contents: a launch command is world-readable in the host
#                  process table for the agent's whole life, so the brief travels
#                  filesystem -> worker and only its address travels argv -> worker.
#                  Never reintroduce a template that composes the brief BODY into
#                  the launch line (an `encode launch-brief < __BRIEF__` shape, a
#                  `$(cat __BRIEF__)`, or any equivalent);
#                  tests/fm-spawn-brief-off-argv.test.sh executes every template
#                  and fails if a brief body reaches any argv.
#     __TURNEND__  absolute path to state/<task-id>.turn-ended (for harnesses whose
#                  turn-end signal rides the launch command, e.g. codex -c notify=[...])
#     __CLAUDESETTINGS__ absolute path to the per-task Claude settings overlay; the
#                  overlay is written ONLY when the launch command names it, and a
#                  claude-shaped raw launch command gets --settings for it injected
#     __CODEXCONFIG__ Codex profile overrides parsed from .codex/config.toml, plus the
#                  crewmate-only sandbox network grant (docs/codex-sandbox-network.md)
#     __PIEXT__    absolute path to state/<task-id>.pi-ext.ts (pi turn-end extension,
#                  written by this script; outside the worktree to avoid pi's trust gate)
#     __PITURNEND__ absolute path to .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts in a pi secondmate home
#     __OPINPUT__   absolute path to the canonical operational-input encoder
#     __PIBRIEFENV__ shell assignment identifying the exact Pi positional launch pointer
# Per-harness turn-end hooks are installed automatically; some live outside the worktree.
# grok uses a firstmate-owned global hook under ${GROK_HOME:-$HOME/.grok}/hooks
# plus a gitignored .fm-grok-turnend worktree pointer and a state token.
# On success prints: spawned <id> harness=<name> kind=<ship|scout|secondmate> mode=<mode> yolo=<on|off> window=<backend-target> worktree=<path>
# mode/yolo are resolved per-project from data/projects.md for ship/scout tasks;
# secondmate spawns record mode=secondmate, yolo=off, home=, and projects=.

# harness's installed CLI was checked for a native prompt-file flag and none has
# one on its supervised interactive path (docs/brief-off-argv.md records the
# versions and the exact help output), so the pointer that
# `fm-operational-input.sh launch-pointer` builds is the one mechanism all five
# share: the worker opens the file itself. A template that puts the brief body
# back on the line republishes every crewmate's instructions to every account on
# the host, and to every same-account sibling worker, for as long as the agent
# runs. Setting a brief-path variable does NOT satisfy this contract on its own -
# __PIBRIEFENV__ already did that while the body still rode the same line, which
# is exactly the half-converted shape that reads as done and is not.
